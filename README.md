ZedEity
=======

ZedEity is a little Z80 emulator for the Z80 CPU.

## Features
- Currently implemented a subset of the Z80 CPU, just to write Hello World on the screen.
- Rudimentary basic hand-rolled testing framework in place using my SnapShot test library, updated to .NET 8.
- Not much more yet.

#Why?
I wanted to try out F# so it seem a good project to me.
